## How to get Leaderboard
Prompt used for chat gpt: is there a way to extract the raw data from a website table?

### Console this works.
https://www.pgatour.com/tournaments/2025/masters-tournament/R2025014/leaderboard

```
[...document.querySelectorAll("table tr")].map(row =>
  [...row.querySelectorAll("td, th")].map(cell => cell.innerText)
)
```
### Python Maybe?
```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://example.com/table"
res = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, "html.parser")

table = soup.find("table")
rows = table.find_all("tr")
data = [[cell.text.strip() for cell in row.find_all(["td", "th"])] for row in rows]

```

## Data Structure

The application uses three main data files:

1. `mastersLeaderboard.ts`: Contains the official tournament leaderboard data
2. `mockGolfers.ts`: Maps leaderboard data to pool-usable format
3. `mockData.ts`: Processes pool member picks and calculates standings

## Sorting Options

The player list within each pool member's details can be sorted in two ways:

1. **By Score**: Shows players ordered by their total tournament score
2. **By Group**: Shows players in their original selection order (1-15)

## View Modes

- **Current**: Shows the ongoing tournament standings
- **Past**: Displays historical tournament results

- Built with React and TypeScript
- Uses Material-UI for components and styling

- Real-time score updates (when connected to live data)
